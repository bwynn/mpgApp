# MyMpg
## Overview
MyMpg is a mobile geared node application. It features user-authentication and allows for a user to create their own profile, where they can keep track of their car or cars' mpg. When a user is logged into their account, they can review previous records, mpg averages filtered by car, and they can most importantly - add their details to track their mpg.
